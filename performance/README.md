# Performance Benchmarks

This directory holds a simple depth benchmark for the C search engine.

- `board_empty.txt`: 7x7 empty board input fed to the engine.
- `depth_benchmark.sh`: Rebuilds the engine once and times moves for depths 6â€“10 using the `ENGINE_MAX_DEPTH` environment variable.
- `depth_benchmark_results.txt`: Captured output from `depth_benchmark.sh` as executed on this host (shared CPU, Render-like). Includes the engine's column choice and `/usr/bin/time` statistics.

To reproduce, run from the repo root:

```bash
performance/depth_benchmark.sh
```

The script writes fresh results back to `depth_benchmark_results.txt` each time.
